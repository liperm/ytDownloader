# ytDownloader

Little project to donwload mp4/mp3 files from YouTube (FOR STUDY PURPOSE ONLY)

# Dependencies
- latest version of `Python`
- `pytube 12.1.2` and `moviepy 1.0.3`

# Usage Instructions

First of all you gonna need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the dependencies.

After that, create a `.env` file with a `FILE_DESTINATION` variable. This is going to be the path of your final file (or just put the path directly in the `FILE_DESTINATION` variable in the code).

Just run the file with your regular `python3` command, give the YouTube video/playlist URL, choose if you want it in mp4 or mp3 and that's it :).
